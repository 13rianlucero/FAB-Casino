## Introduction

- `FAB Casino` is a Casino themed, mobile game application on iOS. 
- The app user can play games, and walk around the virtual Casino. 
- The objective is to obtain more virtual chips(in-game currency), just like in any real-world casino. 
- Chips can be gained by playing and bidding in any of the three games.

## Brainstorm
```
Overall App Idea Brainstorm: 
  ● Mobile app named: FAB Casino 
  ● Casino arcade room 
  ● Player has their own character, they can move their character around
    the casino environment, and walk up to a game and be able to play it 
  ● Games: blackjack (21), Slot Machine, Roulette wheel. 
  ● In-game currency: user will get a daily amt of chips, and then can win 
    some more chips from playing in any of the three games. 
  ● Name of app Ideas: 
      ○ Mafia 
      ○ Casino game 
      ○ FAB casino 
      ○ Mafino 
      ○ Nerd cave 
      ○ Dont let ur mom find out 
      ○ Palacio del tesoro
```

## Platform
```
iOS, built on xcode (storyboard, viewcontrollers, etc) 

Idea: 
   ● For now we have decided to stick with iOS. 
   
Final Platforms: 
  ● We will be only supporting iOS 
  ● Using xCode, swift language, etc. for this project since this is a swift class
```

## Team
```
Best way to contact you. Could be a team email list, the email addresses of each
member, the email of the group representative, or whatever makes the most sense. 
  ● The best way to contact us is probably through discord.
  ● Names & Emails:
    ○ Brian Lucero (13rianlucero@csu.fullerton.edu), 
    ○ Angel Zambrano (AngelZ@csu.fullerton.edu), 
    ○ Fahad Alsowaylim (Fss@csu.fullerton.edu)
```

## Background and Motivation
```
  ● (Angel) - really wanted to make games so making a bunch for this app sounds great. 
  ● (Brian) - I was inspired by GTA V and Lego Star Wars Videogame to make a mobile game
              that is very similar, for this project. Would feel proud enough to show 
              the game to friends and family once it is done.
  ● (Fahad) - I’m really excited to start working on this project, being that this is a 
              swift language class, getting a chance to use what we learn in class will 
              make sure the information we learn in class sticks in our brains, and maybe 
              later it becomes muscle memory.
